# socialMediaApp
This app will allow the owner (admin) to enter some posts and they will show up in his clients' app.
Posts will either be images, videos, or texts.
Videos will be Youtube videos, with the links referring to the videos.
I will be using recyclerView to show the posts. Maybe Volley to contact the server and update/get from the database.
I hope I will be doing this with my students.
